      <SectionCard title="1. Account & access">
        <Text style={[styles.body, { color: theme.muted }]}>
          Registration payment (or an approved promo) is required for ACTIVE status.
          KYC is required for payouts only — not for signup or submitting setups.
          Banned or suspended accounts cannot withdraw or enroll in vault products.

      <SectionCard title="2. Preferred withdrawals">
        <Text style={[styles.body, { color: theme.muted }]}>
          Prefer weekly withdrawals on Sundays (UTC) or monthly on the 1st (UTC),
          depending on platform settings. You can withdraw anytime. Off-schedule
          requests add an off-schedule penalty (default 8% of gross) on top of the
          processing fee. Investor VIP may waive the processing fee ($0); it does
          not waive the off-schedule penalty unless separately stated. Every
          withdrawal requires an email OTP before funds are requested.

      <SectionCard title="3. On-chain vault contract">
        <Text style={[styles.body, { color: theme.muted }]}>
          Enroll on Chain: accept terms → document + liveness KYC → approval →
          deposit. Minimum $2,000 USDT. Indicative bands: 10% for $2,000–$5,000;
          15% above $5,000. Actual percentage may change with deposit size,
          available funds, market conditions, and past user behavior. Contract
          withdrawals deduct 5%. The dashboard stays empty until approval; the
          contract launches after funded activation. You may cancel and restart
          enrollment before launch.

      <SectionCard title="4. Investor & depositor programs">
        <Text style={[styles.body, { color: theme.muted }]}>
          Daily credits run at the platform yield window shown in your local
          country time. Illustrated yields are not a guarantee of profit. Pause,
          auto-stop, and VIP rules may apply as shown in the Invest hub.

      <SectionCard title="5. Risk">
        <Text style={[styles.body, { color: theme.muted }]}>
          Trading and capital allocation involve substantial risk of loss. Virtual
          accounts, rankings, and illustrated yields do not guarantee profits.
          Cryptocurrency transfers are irreversible once broadcast.
